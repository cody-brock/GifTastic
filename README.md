## Usage

The main page already has few pre-determined descriptors ("happy," "surprised," "shocked," and "interested") to get you started, which appear as orange buttons.  

Clicking on these buttons calls the giphy api and populates 10 images on the page related to that keyword.  

To play the gif, click on the image.  To stop the gif, click on the image again.

If you would like to add more keywords, type your new keyword into the field labeled "Add a Reaction," then click "Submit."  You will see your keyword added to the orange buttons above.
